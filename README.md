# 16-Bit-Hell
An SNES assembly project which displays a series of Mode 1 images of an AI-generated hell converted using in superfamiconv.

It is coded to use the WLA-DX assembler, and has only been tested under Linux. There are scripts to assemble and link the files, one which launches "bsnes-accuracy" with the result, and one that doesn't. Be careful, if there is an error, an old version of the ROM may be launched and appear without changes. It assembles to a 24mbit LoROM .sfc file as of this writing. It has been tested on a real SNES using an FXPak Pro.

This hell is non-denominational and purely fictional, not meant to be religious propaganda. I just think depictions of hell are interesting.
